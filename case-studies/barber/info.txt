Buggy file: barber.erl
Fixed file: barber_fixed.erl

-----------------------------------------------------------
Typical session:

$ erl
> c(barber).
{ok,barber}
> barber:main().

Customers: John and Joe

'John' finished

**deadlock**

Expected behaviour:

$ c(barber_fixed).
{ok,barber_fixed}
> barber_fixed:main().

Customers: John and Joe

'John' finished
'Joe' finished
stop
-----------------------------------------------------------

Using the debugger

* First, instrument the buggy code and get a trace:

$ ./rebar3 shell
> tracer:trace(barber, main, [], [{dir, "case-studies/barber"}, {output, "case-studies/barber/trace"}]).
> q().

>>the logs can be found in the folder "trace"

* Now, let's inspect the buggy execution using CauDEr:

$ ./_build/default/bin/cauder

>> Load in barber.erl and the logged trace in folder trace

* A typical debugging session:

>> Replay process 74 (main) 100 steps
    -->some processes still have a nonempty log, but this is fine
    -->we want to see what happened with joe
>> Rollback receive of message 1
    -->many actions undone because of causal dependencies
>> Replay 78 (shop) 1 step
    -->we receive new customer joe, as expected
>> Let us now look at process 78 (shop) and its log, and see if everything goes fine:
    --> it should first send "wakeup" to the barber (replay send 4): ok
    --> it should now receive "ready" from the barber (replay receive 2): ok
    --> it should now send a customer (John) to the barber (replay send 6): ok
    --> let us now go forward step by step till the next loop of barber_shop...
        after 6 steps, we see that the next call is barber_shop(81, [{79, 'John'}]),
        which is incorrect! (we sent John, but remove Joe from the waiting room)

  * Solution: change the implementation of removeCustomer for a function that
    removes the last element instead of the first one... -> barber_fixed.erl
