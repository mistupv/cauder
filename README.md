**_This tool is still under development_**

### Core Erlang version

In 2020, we decided to rewrite CauDEr to work directly with Erlang instead of
Core Erlang. The main reasons for this change where simplicity,
user-friendliness and breaking changes introduced in newer version of
Erlang/OTP.

The old version of CauDEr developed for Core Erlang is still available at
[mistupv/cauder-core](https://github.com/mistupv/cauder-core), however it is no
longer being actively maintained.

## Dependencies

* Erlang 23 or higher

## Building

To build the project, type:

    ./rebar3 compile

To create an _escript_, type:

    ./rebar3 escriptize

To create a release for your platform, type:

    ./rebar3 reltool

## Reviewing

To run a success typing analysis, type:

    ./rebar3 dialyzer

To run a cross-reference analysis, type:

    ./rebar3 xref

To run the code formatter, type:

    ./rebar3 fmt

To run the style reviewer, type:

    ./rebar3 lint

To run the unit tests, type:

    ./rebar3 eunit

To run the common tests, type:

    ./rebar3 ct

To clean-up the build files, type:

    ./rebar3 clean

## Running

### Using the Erlang shell

To start an Erlang shell with all the required dependencies, type:

    ./rebar3 shell

There are multiples ways to run CauDEr from the Erlang shell:

#### Like an _escript_

```
Eshell V11.0  (abort with ^G)
1> cauder:main().
ok
```

ℹ️ This function will wait for the CauDEr window to close before returning,
which means the shell will be blocked.

#### Like an application

```
Eshell V11.0  (abort with ^G)
1> application:start(wx), application:start(cauder).
ok
```

ℹ️ To stop CauDEr you can use `application:stop(cauder)`, or simply close the
window.

#### Manually

```
Eshell V11.0  (abort with ^G)
1> cauder:start(). % Starting the debugger
{ok,<0.80.0>}
2> cauder_wx:start(). % Starting the GUI
{ok,<0.82.0>,{wx_ref,35,wxFrame,<0.82.0>}}
```

⚠️ If you try to start the GUI without previously starting the debugger, it will
fail with the following error: `{error,{not_started,cauder}}`

### Using the _escript_

    ./_build/default/bin/cauder

ℹ️ This will block the current shell until the CauDEr window is closed.

In Unix systems a symbolic link pointing to `./_build/default/bin/cauder` will
be created in the root of the project.

### Using the release

    ./_build/default/reltool/cauder

ℹ️ This script will start CauDEr in detached mode.

## Creating a log

To trace the execution of a function call you should use either the `tracer:trace/3` or `tracer:trace/4` function. Both
functions accept as their first three argument the components of a function application, i.e. to
trace `apply(Module, Function, Arguments)` you should call `tracer:trace(Module, Function, Arguments)`, they also return
the trace in case you want to use it directly.

The optional fourth argument is a collection of configuration options for the trace process, these options can be
provider either as a `proplist` or as a `map`. The available options are:

* `{dir, Dir}`: the directory where the source code is located. Default is the current directory (`"."`).
* `{modules, Modules}`: a list of additional modules to instrument. Default is an empty list (`[]`).
* `{timeout, Timeout}`: the number of milliseconds the tracer can run, or the atom `infinity` to run forever (this is
  however not recommended as there is currently no way to stop the tracer without losing the trace). Default is `10000`.
* `{stamp_mode, Mode}`: the policy through which stamps in messages are managed. Default is `centralized`.
* `{output, Dir}`: the directory where the trace will be saved, or an empty list (`[]`) to not save the trace to disk.
  Default is `[]`.

For distributed programs simply start the Erlang runtime system as a distributed node, using the `-name` or `-sname`
options.

### Stamp Modes

The available stamp modes are:

* `centralized`: There is a central authority that distributes the stamp, it can always be considered safe.
* `distributed`: Every send generates its own stamp, more lightweight but safe only if one system instance is involved.

### Example

Suppose that you want to trace the `barber` case study located in the `case-studies/barber/` folder, and you would also
like to store the results in a new folder called `trace/`.

If you prefer using a `proplist` for options, type:

    tracer:trace(barber, main, [], [{dir, "case-studies/barber"}, {output, "case-studies/barber/trace"}]).

Or if you prefer using a `map` for options, type:

    tracer:trace(barber, main, [], #{dir => "case-studies/barber", output => "case-studies/barber/trace"}).
